- 👋 Hi, I’m @Coticondensada
- 👀 I’m interested in Statistical Physics applying to different science fields, such as, social science, biology science, among others
- 🌱 I’m currently learning high-performace programming and how to connect spins and particles with dailylife interactions
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... maybe in some research group of complex systems

>> The idea of creating this repositories is to share some research that im doing and i want to people motivate with science, specially with physics
>> In addition, i want to improved my skills on two programming languages: Python and C.. soon Wolfram language :)
